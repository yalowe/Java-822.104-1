# Calender to the project:
* Part 1 - create a file with the sql queries of all the tables ( Craete table + CRUD ) - 05/12/2018 - 12/12/2018
* Part 2 - Craete java bean classes for the tables in the DB.
  * Create all the logical validations in the setter (email should contain `@`, etc...)
  * Every non-valid value that is passed to the setter - will throw an error (create a matching error class to each validation)    
  
   12/12/2018 - 19/12/2018
* Part 3 - Add to the setter of email (that is in person and company) a validation that checks if the email is valid - with a regular_expressions   

   19/12/2018 - 23/12/2018
* Part 4 - Add DAO + DBDAO
   23/12/2018 - 13/01/2019
* Part 5 - 
  * seperate the project to different packages
  * add to each class + function `javadoc` comments
  * generate html `javadoc` pages - and convert them to md pages   
  
   13/01/2019 - 16/01/2019
