## The Java Programming Language Platforms
* Java technology is both a programming language and a platform. 
* The Java programming language is a high-level object-oriented language that has a particular syntax and style. 
* A Java platform is a particular environment in which Java programming language applications run.
* There are four platforms of the Java programming language:
    * Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE)
    * Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE)
    * Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME)
    * JavaFX
* All Java platforms consist of a Java Virtual Machine (VM) and an application programming interface (API). 
* The Java Virtual Machine is a program, for a particular hardware and software platform, that runs Java technology applications. 
* An API is a collection of software components that you can use to create other software components or applications. 
* Each Java platform provides a virtual machine and an API, and this allows applications written for that platform to run on any compatible system with all the advantages of the Java programming language: platform-independence, power, stability, ease-of-development, and security.

### Java SE
* Java SE's API provides the core functionality of the Java programming language. 
* It defines everything from the basic types and objects of the Java programming language to high-level classes that are used for networking, security, database access, graphical user interface (GUI) development, and XML parsing.
* In addition to the core API, the Java SE platform consists of a virtual machine, development tools, deployment technologies, and other class libraries and toolkits commonly used in Java technology applications.

### Java EE
* The Java EE platform is built on top of the Java SE platform. 
* The Java EE platform provides an API and runtime environment for developing and running large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable, and secure network applications.

### Java ME
* The Java ME platform provides an API and a small-footprint virtual machine for running Java programming language applications on small devices, like mobile phones. 
* The API is a subset of the Java SE API, along with special class libraries useful for small device application development. 
* Java ME applications are often clients of Java EE platform services.

### JavaFX
* JavaFX is a platform for creating rich internet applications using a lightweight user-interface API. 
* JavaFX applications use hardware-accelerated graphics and media engines to take advantage of higher-performance clients and a modern look-and-feel as well as high-level APIs for connecting to networked data sources. 
* JavaFX applications may be clients of Java EE platform services.
