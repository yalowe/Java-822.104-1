# JSP (JavaServer Pages)
## What is a JSP and what is it used for?
* Java Server Pages (JSP) is a platform independent presentation layer technology. 
* JSPs are normal HTML pages with Java code pieces embedded in them. 
* JSP pages are typically saved to `*.jsp files`. 
* A JSP compiler is used in the background to generate a Servlet from the JSP page.


## What is JSP technology?
* The JavaServer Pages technology enables you to generate dynamic web content, such as HTML, DHTML, XHTML, and XML files, to include in a Web application. 
* JSP files are one way to implement server-side dynamic page content. 
* JSP files allow a Web server, such as Apache Tomcat, to add content dynamically to your HTML pages before they are sent to a requesting browser. 
* When you deploy a JSP file to a Web server that provides a servlet engine, it is preprocessed into a servlet that runs on the Web server. This is in contrast with client-side JavaScript (within SCRIPT tags), which is run in a browser. 
* A JSP page is ideal for tasks that are better suited to execution on the server, such as accessing databases or calling Enterprise Java beans. 

## What is JSP page?
* A JSP page is a text-based document that contains two types of text:  
    * static template data, which can be expressed in any text-based format such as HTML, SVG, WML, and XML.
    * JSP elements, which construct dynamic content.
